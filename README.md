# a2.games

a2.games is a free opensource gaming website by [Raghu Chinnannan](https://raghu.ch) built primarily using KaboomJS and vanilla JS.

Primarily built as a fun project to engage my kids by showing their faces on the games and also as an oppurtunity to learn KaboomJS.

Luckily, I was able to get this cool domain for about â‚¹1200 (~$15) and it's live, that's the origin story.

## Usage
- It's completely free to play.
- Might add some sponsorship links to monetise it in future.

## License & Contributing
- Do whatever you want with this code.
- I'll also do the same with your contributions to this repo.
- My decision is final with anything related to this project but I'm a very reasonable person.

### Contributing
- Contributing is as simple as sending a PR. 
- So far most games are built using Kaboom.js and vanilla js, but you are free to use any library as long as it's simple and can be served as a static site.

## Disclaimer
- Don't tell me the design/code/game sucks, because I already know it.
- If you can do better, send me a PR, it's 99% guranteed to be merged unless it's worser than what I have already.
